boolean add(Object e) Inserts the specified element into this queue if it is possible to do so
immediately without violating capacity restrictions, returning true upon success
and throwing an IllegalStateException if no space is currently available.

Object   element() Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue.

boolean offer(Object e) Inserts the specified element into this queue if it is possible to do so
immediately without violating capacity restrictions.

Object   peek() Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue, or returns null if this
queue is empty.

Object   poll() Retrieves and removes the head of this queue, or returns null if this queue is empty.

Object   remove() Retrieves and removes the head of this queue.


Questions:
boolean add(Object e) - when does it have capacity problems? Just pick a maximum size?

boolean offer(Object e) - same like the "add" method, jut without IllegalStateException?
And returns true upon success

Object   peek() - same like the "element" method, just returns null in case of empty Queue?

Object   poll() - "what does removes the head of this queue" means? delete that element,
which would be the next one according to FIFO?
